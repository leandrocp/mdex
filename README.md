## Features

Compliant with [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org) and [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://github.github.com/gfm) specifications with extra [extensions](https://docs.rs/comrak/latest/comrak/struct.ExtensionOptions.html)
as Wiki Links, Discord Markdown tags, and emoji. Also supports syntax highlighting out-of-the-box using the [Autumn](https://github.com/leandrocp/autumn) library.

Under the hood it's calling the [comrak](https://crates.io/crates/comrak) APIs to process Markdown,
a fast Rust crate that ports the cmark fork maintained by GitHub, a widely and well adopted Markdown implementation.

The AST format is based on [Floki](https://hex.pm/packages/floki) so the same API to manipulate HTML can be used to manipulate Markdown documents.
Check out some examples at [mdex/examples/](https://github.com/leandrocp/mdex/tree/main/examples)

And some samples are available at https://mdex-c31.pages.dev

## Installation

Add `:mdex` dependency:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:mdex, "~> 0.1"}
  ]
end
```

## Usage

```elixir
Mix.install([{:mdex, "~> 0.1"}])
```

```elixir
MDEx.to_html!("# Hello")
"<h1>Hello</h1>\n"
```

```elixir
MDEx.to_html!("# Hello :smile:", extension: [shortcodes: true])
"<h1>Hello ðŸ˜„</h1>\n"
```

## Sigils

```elixir
import MDEx.Sigil

~M|# Hello from `~M` sigil|
"<h1>Hello from <code>~M</code> sigil</h1>\n"

~M|`~M` can return the AST too|AST
[
  {"document", [], [{"paragraph", [], [{"code", [{"num_backticks", 1}, {"literal", "~M"}], []}, " can return the AST too"]}]}
]

~m|[{"document", [], [{"paragraph", [], ["interpolation in the ", {"code", [{"num_backticks", 1}, {"literal", "#{"AST"}"}], []}, " as well"]}]}]|MD
"interpolation in the `AST` as well\n"
```

See https://hexdocs.pm/mdex/MDEx.Sigil.html for more examples.

## Parsing

Converts Markdown to an AST data structure that can be inspected and manipulated to change the content of the document.

The data structure shape is exactly the same as the one used by [Floki](https://github.com/philss/floki) so we can reuse the same APIs and keep the same mental model when
working with these documents, either Markdown or HTML, where each node is represented as:

```elixir
{name, attributes, children}
```

Example:

```elixir
MDEx.parse_document!("# Hello")
[{"document", [], [{"heading", [{"level", 1}, {"setext", false}], ["Hello"]}]}]
```

Note that text nodes have no attributes nor children, so it's represented as a string inside a list.

You can find the full AST spec on the MDEx module types section.

## Formatting

Converts the AST to a human-readable document, most commonly to HTML, example:

```elixir
MDEx.to_html!([{"document", [], [{"heading", [{"level", 1}, {"setext", false}], ["Hello"]}]}])
"<h1>Hello</h1>\n"
```

_More formats can be added in the future._

Any missing attribute will be filled with the default value, and extra attributes will be ignored. So you could have the same result with:

```elixir
MDEx.to_html!([{"document", [], [{"heading", [], ["Hello"]}]}])
"<h1>Hello</h1>\n"
```

Default values are defined on a best-case scenario but as a good practice you should provide all attributes for each node.

Trying to format malformed ASTs will return a `{:error, %DecodeError{}}` describing what and where the error occurred, for example:

```elixir
{:error, decode_error} = MDEx.to_html([{"code", [{1, "foo"}], []}], [])
{:error,
 %MDEx.DecodeError{
   reason: :attr_key_not_string,
   found: "1",
   node: "(<<\"code\">>, [{1,<<\"foo\">>}], [])",
   attr: "(1, <<\"foo\">>)",
   kind: "Integer"
 }}

decode_error |> Exception.message() |> IO.puts()
# invalid attribute key
#
# Expected an attribute key encoded as UTF-8 binary
#
# Got:
#
#   1
#
# Type:
#
#   Integer
#
# In this node:
#
#   (<<"code">>, [{1,<<"foo">>}], [])
#
# In this attribute:
#
#   (1, <<"foo">>)
```

## Options

You can enable extensions and change the output of the generated Markdown by passing any of the available [Comrak Options](https://docs.rs/comrak/latest/comrak/struct.Options.html)
as keyword lists or also an additional `:features` option.

_The full documentation and list of all options with description and examples can be found on the links below:_

* `:extension` - https://docs.rs/comrak/latest/comrak/struct.ExtensionOptions.html
* `:parse` - https://docs.rs/comrak/latest/comrak/struct.ParseOptions.html
* `:render` - https://docs.rs/comrak/latest/comrak/struct.RenderOptions.html
* `:features` - see the available options below

### Features Options

* `:sanitize` (default `false`) - sanitize output using [ammonia](https://crates.io/crates/ammonia).\n Recommended if passing `render: [unsafe_: true]`
* `:syntax_highlight_theme` (default `"onedark"`) - syntax highlight code fences using [autumn themes](https://github.com/leandrocp/autumn/tree/main/priv/themes),
you should pass the filename without special chars and without extension, for example you should pass `syntax_highlight_theme: "adwaita_dark"` to use the [Adwaita Dark](https://github.com/leandrocp/autumn/blob/main/priv/themes/adwaita-dark.toml) theme
* `:syntax_highlight_inline_style` (default `true`) - embed styles in the output for each generated token. You'll need to [serve CSS themes](https://github.com/leandrocp/autumn?tab=readme-ov-file#linked) if inline styles are disabled to properly highlight code

See some examples below on how to use the provided options:

mdex           3.57 K - 6.39x slower +0.24 ms

earmark        0.25 K - 92.19x slower +4.00 ms
```

## Motivation

MDEx was born out of the necessity of parsing CommonMark files, to parse hundreds of files quickly, and to be easily extensible. None of the existing libraries described below met all these requirements at the time.

* [earmark](https://hex.pm/packages/earmark) is extensible but [can't parse](https://github.com/RobertDober/earmark_parser/issues/126) all kinds of documents and is slow to convert hundreds of markdowns.
* [md](https://hex.pm/packages/md) is very extensible but the doc says "If one needs to perfectly parse the common markdown, Md is probably not the correct choice" which is probably the cause for failing to parse many documents.
* [markdown](https://hex.pm/packages/markdown) is not precompiled and has not received updates in a while.
* [cmark](https://hex.pm/packages/cmark) is a fast CommonMark parser but it requires compiling the C library, is hard to extend, and was archived on Apr 2024

_Note that MDEx is the only one that syntax highlights out-of-the-box which contributes to make it slower than cmark._

To finish, a friendly reminder that all libs have their own strengths and trade-offs so use the one that better suit your needs.
